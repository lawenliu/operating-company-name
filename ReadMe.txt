DESCRIBE APPLICATION INTENT:
 This is the application to deal with company name array in different ways.
 Some features need change original CSS to see the result. Such as the question 5, which asks to randomly select color class. But color class only set the "background-image", no effect on the UI result, we have to check the content css in developer tool. So I add the text color information in class to show the difference.
 No add ons
